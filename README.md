# A-Divide-and-Conquer-Strategy-for-High-Dimensional-Bayesian-Factor-Models
We propose a distributed computing framework, based on a divide and conquer strategy and hierarchical modeling, to accelerate posterior inference for high-dimensional factor models. Our approach distributes the task of high-dimensional covariance matrix estimation to multiple cores, solves each subproblem separately via a latent factor model, and then combines these estimates to produce a globale estimate of the covariance matrix. The MATLAB code is available for public use. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02875.pdf.
